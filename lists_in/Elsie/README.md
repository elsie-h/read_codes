The files in this subfolder were put together by myself, either through manual search using the NHS Read code browser, using the OpenSafely Read code browser (version 3 only), or by editing existing codelists.

Files with the prefix 'elsie-horne' were built using the OpenSafely builder tool.

Most other lists were build using the NHS Read code browser, although some may be edits of codelists found elsewhere - I put together these lists before I had decided to create a public repo for all my lists, so I'm afraid I cannot remember the exact sources!
