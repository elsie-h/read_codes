The files in this subfolder with the prefix 'CPRDCAM' were downloaded from [CPRD @ Cambridge â€“ Codes Lists (GOLD)](https://www.phpc.cam.ac.uk/pcu/research/research-groups/crmh/cprd_cam/codelists/v11/).
These files include lists of medications for defining depression and anxiety, along with details for how to implement them.

As I required lists of Read codes rather than gemscript codes, I searched each of the medications in the OpenSAFELY builder to construct a Read code list.
The resulting lists are in the files with the prefix 'elsie-horne'
